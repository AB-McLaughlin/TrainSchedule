        Assuming:
        The first train of the day comes in at 3:00 AM.
        
        The train runs every 17 minutes
        
        The current time is 7:12 PM.
        
        There have been no delays and will be no delays.
        
        
        
        Question:
        How many minutes away is the next train?
        
    var currentTime = 7:12pm = 19:12 
    var firstTrain = 3:00am = 03:00
    var nextTrain = firstTrain + 17 minutes
    var subTrain = nextTrain + 17 minutes
    var lastTrain = (result of loop)- currentTime
        
       moment().startOf('minute').fromNow();
